"""Normality Assumption

A large fraction of the field of statistics is concerned with data that assumes that it was drawn from a Gaussian distribution.

If methods are used that assume a Gaussian distribution, and your data was drawn from a different distribution, the findings may be misleading or plain wrong.

There are a number of techniques that you can check if your data sample is Gaussian or sufficiently Gaussian-like to use the standard techniques, or sufficiently non-Gaussian to instead use non-parametric statistical methods.

This is a key decision point when it comes to choosing statistical methods for your data sample. We can summarize this decision as follows:

If Data Is Gaussian:
	Use Parametric Statistical Methods
Else:
	Use Nonparametric Statistical Methods

There is also some middle ground where we can assume that the data is Gaussian-enough to use parametric methods or that we can use data preparation techniques to transform the data to be sufficiently Gaussian to use the parametric methods.

There are three main areas where you may need to make this evaluation of a data sample in a machine learning project; they are:

Input data to the model in the case of fitting models.
Model evaluation results in the case of model selection.
Residual errors from model predictions in the case of regression.
In this tutorial, we will look at two classes of techniques for checking whether a sample of data is Gaussian:

Graphical Methods. These are methods for plotting the data and qualitatively evaluating whether the data looks Gaussian.
Statistical Tests. These are methods that calculate statistics on the data and quantify how likely it is that the data was drawn from a Gaussian distribution.
Methods of this type are often called normality tests.

Test Dataset
Before we start looking at normality tests, letâ€™s first develop a test dataset that we can use throughout this tutorial.

We will generate a small sample of random numbers drawn from a Gaussian distribution.

The choice of Gaussian random numbers for the test dataset means that we do expect each test to correctly identify the distribution, nevertheless, the small-ish sample size may introduce some noise into the results.

We will use the randn() NumPy function to generate random Gaussian numbers with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, so-called standard, normal variables. We will then shift them to have a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 5.

The complete example is listed below.
"""
# generate gaussian data
from numpy.random import seed
from numpy.random import randn
from numpy import mean
from numpy import std
# seed the random number generator
seed(1)
# generate univariate observations
data = 5 * randn(100) + 50
# summarize
print('mean=%.3f stdv=%.3f' % (mean(data), std(data)))
""""
Running the example generates the sample and prints the mean and standard deviation of the sample.

We can see that the mean and standard deviation are reasonable but rough estimations of the true underlying population mean and standard deviation, given the small-ish sample size.
