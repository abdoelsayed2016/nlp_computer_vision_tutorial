"""Normality Assumption

A large fraction of the field of statistics is concerned with data that assumes that it was drawn from a Gaussian distribution.

If methods are used that assume a Gaussian distribution, and your data was drawn from a different distribution, the findings may be misleading or plain wrong.

There are a number of techniques that you can check if your data sample is Gaussian or sufficiently Gaussian-like to use the standard techniques, or sufficiently non-Gaussian to instead use non-parametric statistical methods.

This is a key decision point when it comes to choosing statistical methods for your data sample. We can summarize this decision as follows:
